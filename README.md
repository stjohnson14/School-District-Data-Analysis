In this case study, I am acting as the Chief Data Scientist for a fictional city's school district, helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, I am asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I am given every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My responsibility was to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.
